Step 1 - Website Landing Page: https://www.figma.com/proto/lIkGjwm8F4U8Xwv2fePEHO/Learn2Earn?type=design&node-id=449-1926&scaling=scale-down&page-id=177%3A146&starting-point-node-id=449%3A1926

Purpose:
Front facing area for students to:
A) Login to the platform
B) Sign up for the platform

Highlights popular mentors and courses to entice sign up


Step 2 -  Sign Up Process for the platform: https://www.figma.com/proto/lIkGjwm8F4U8Xwv2fePEHO/Learn2Earn?type=design&node-id=182-1222&scaling=scale-down&page-id=177%3A146&starting-point-node-id=449%3A1926

Purpose
To be as frictionless as possible so we can quickly get them into the community or training area.
Students can sign up for free
They can use Google or FB to create their accounts
They can enable 2FA

Step 3 - Creating their Mentorland front facing profile:
https://www.figma.com/proto/lIkGjwm8F4U8Xwv2fePEHO/Learn2Earn?type=design&node-id=201-908&scaling=scale-down&page-id=177%3A146&starting-point-node-id=449%3A1926

They have the option to be doxed or to remain anonymous when creating their profile
We ask a few preliminary questions here in order to recommend mentors and communities they can join based on their answers
They can then join the free level of any of those recommended communities
We then show them courses taught by their chosen mentors so they can purchase additional access if they'd like or they can simply continue on to the free area

Step 4 - Their home area: https://www.figma.com/proto/lIkGjwm8F4U8Xwv2fePEHO/Learn2Earn?type=design&node-id=1002-14741&scaling=scale-down&page-id=177%3A146&starting-point-node-id=449%3A1926

Once their profile is set up they are taken to a home feed where new posts from the various communities they are in are posted
Purpose of this area is to see recent posts and updates from the communities they are a part of and also see progress for various milestones.
From here they can go to their profiles or visit communities


Step 5 - Their Profiles: https://www.figma.com/proto/lIkGjwm8F4U8Xwv2fePEHO/Learn2Earn?type=design&node-id=290-1027&scaling=scale-down&page-id=177%3A146&starting-point-node-id=449%3A1926


Inside their profile dashboard they see their schedule, including any live classes they have for that day, they also have a list of favourited classmates , mentors and communities

Inside the profile area you can access various tabs: 
my communities: a list of communities you currently have access cards to enter
My wallet: Showing your various access cards, event cards, enrichment packs and certifications
Notifications: self explanatory
Wishlist: Courses or mentorships I have favorited or added to my wishlist for future purchase
My schedule: a calendar with my live classes shown

Side note - Access Cards

There will be 3 core types of access cards
A) Mentorship access - Non resellable, grant access to the communities
B) Course access- Resellable in the marketplace
C) Enrichment packs - Resellable in the marketplace

Reasoning: We want the students to be able to resell and earn back some $$ from the courses, the courses will also drive people back to the communities and grow audiences to purchase other courses and mentorships from that mentor. We do not want them to resell high ticket mentorship access as to not devalue it.

Step 6 - The communities area: https://www.figma.com/proto/lIkGjwm8F4U8Xwv2fePEHO/Learn2Earn?type=design&node-id=306-2287&scaling=scale-down&page-id=177%3A146&starting-point-node-id=449%3A1926

The main community feed contains 3 levels
A) The free community
B) The low ticket community
C) The High Ticket mentorship

Each level will contain different access to courses and features

The communities feed operates much like a facebook group and reddit community with recent posts, comments, likes ect. On the side we implement gamification tools:
A leaderboard (points are scored by engaging in the community and also through completing course material, milestones and certifications)
A progress bar to
A) show your progress towards a milestone or certification your working towards
B) keep the reward for hitting that milestone or certification front and center
A notification showing you how to get your next “Badge” = mileston or certification and what the reward for that would be, linking to either a course or some other action to take


Within the community there are five main tabs:
Community feed housing everything described above
Courses feed:
When you click into the communities courses feed you are shown all available courses in this community. The ones you have access to and the ones you do not. YPu can buy the individual course access / alternatively you are also shown which courses you are granted automatically by buying into different levels of the mentorship.
Channels:
This is the internal community chat area, our thought here was to replicate a slack or discord style messaging area
Live call schedule:
A calendar showing your class schedule for this community. Events contain clickable links to join the call.
Ask your mentors:
A dedicated feed where only specific mentors can respond to student questions. IE an ads expert responds to ads questions.
All of these tabs contain access points (chat, calls, courses ect) that can be gamified based on what level of mentorship theyve purchased OR gamification aspects like milestones to earn them.

Step 7 - Courses: https://www.figma.com/proto/lIkGjwm8F4U8Xwv2fePEHO/Learn2Earn?type=design&node-id=1060-14622&scaling=scale-down&page-id=177%3A146&starting-point-node-id=449%3A1926

Main course area is meant to house the video front and center, a side menu showing categories and additional course videos as well as 5 sub sections:
Lesson information: Customizable Lesson description and homework information is housed here.
Packs / Skins: Is where there enrichment packs for this course are shown, they can turn them on or off here.
Enrich: This is where they would create their own enrichment pack for the lesson or course
Favourite lessons: Is where they can house direct links to their favourited lessons within the course
Access cards: shows the course and related event access cards.


The course area also has built in multiple choice quizzes


Side note - Enrichment Packs:
https://www.figma.com/proto/lIkGjwm8F4U8Xwv2fePEHO/Learn2Earn?type=design&node-id=1060-16286&scaling=scale-down&page-id=177%3A146&starting-point-node-id=449%3A1926


Enrichment packs are a novel idea to this platform. The concept is to allow people to time stamp crib notes, videos and articles to a specific place within the lessons inside the course and then mint an NFT containing all those time stamped notes.
Others can they buy this “skin” for the course so they can have these time stamped insights as they go through.
Essentially allowing someone to say how theyve applied / used the couse material to achieve their success, creating community generated enhancements to the overall program.


Side note - Marketplace:
https://www.figma.com/proto/lIkGjwm8F4U8Xwv2fePEHO/Learn2Earn?type=design&node-id=673-6132&scaling=scale-down&page-id=177%3A146&starting-point-node-id=449%3A1926


NFT style marketplace for the resale of course access and enrichment packs by the students as well as an area where Mentors can list there mentorship / community access cards for sale.
